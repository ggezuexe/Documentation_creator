The `main.py` file contains a Python script designed to automate the process of generating documentation and adding comments to Python source code files within a specified directory. The script uses the OpenAI API to generate natural language text based on the code content, contributing to better documentation and commentary for clarity and maintenance. Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionality:

1. **Imports and Dependencies**: The script imports necessary Python modules such as `openai`, `os`, `concurrent.futures`, and `time` for handling file operations, parallel processing, and interactions with the OpenAI API.

2. **File_to_comment Class**: This class encapsulates details about a file including its name, content, and directory path. It serves as a structured way to handle file data within the script.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `remove_file_extension()`: Removes the file extension from a filename.
   - `read_files_in_directory()`: Reads all the files in a specified directory and returns a list of `File_to_comment` objects representing each file.

4. **Documentation Generation Functions**:
   - `create_documentation()`: Generates detailed documentation for a single file using the OpenAI API and writes the content to a markdown file.
   - `create_summary_documentation()`: Generates a consolidated summary document for all files in the directory.

5. **Comment Addition Function**:
   - `comment_codes()`: Generates and inserts comments directly into the source code of the files to explain and clarify code blocks or logic.

6. **Concurrency Management**:
   - `menu_1()` and `menu_3()`: These functions handle multi-threading operations where documentation and comments are generated in parallel across multiple files to improve efficiency.

7. **Interactive Menu System**:
   - `main()`: Provides an interactive CLI (Command-Line Interface) menu that allows users to choose an operation (documentation generation, summary document creation, or adding comments), and handles user inputs and validation.

8. **Execution Control**: The script uses conditional statements and loops to manage the flow of operations based on user input, ensuring that the appropriate functions are called and executed effectively.

Overall, `main.py` is a comprehensive toolkit designed to assist software engineers by automating the generation of helpful documentation and comments for Python code, leveraging advanced AI text generation capabilities.
