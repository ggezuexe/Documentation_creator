The Python script named `f_13.py` is designed to take two positive integers as input from the user and print all even numbers that lie between these two numbers. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Input Collection**: The script prompts the user to input two positive integers, referred to as `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`, the script iterates through numbers from `szam_1 + 1` to `szam_2 - 1`.
   - Conversely, if `szam_1` is greater than `szam_2`, it iterates from `szam_2 + 1` to `szam_1 - 1`.
   - For each number in the specified range, the script checks if it is even. If it is, the number is printed.
   - If `szam_1` equals `szam_2`, the script prints a message indicating that both numbers are equal, and no range checks or printing of even numbers occurs.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is either a series of even numbers printed on separate lines (depending on the range between the two input values) or a message stating that the two numbers are equal.

This script is useful for scenarios where identifying even numbers between two points is needed, such as in number theory or coding exercises involving loops and conditionals.
