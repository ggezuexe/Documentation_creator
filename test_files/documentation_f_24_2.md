The Python script `f_24_2.py` performs a simple text manipulation task:

1. **Prompt for User Input**: The script initially prompts the user to input some text. A message is displayed asking the user to "Írj valamit te cigány" which translates to "Write something, you gypsy." It's important to note that this prompt includes a derogatory term, which is considered offensive and inappropriate in most contexts.

2. **Remove Spaces**: After receiving the input, the script removes all spaces from the user's input. This is done using the `replace` method, which replaces each space (" ") with an empty string ("").

3. **Output the Modified Text**: Finally, the script prints the modified text, which is the original user input with all spaces removed.

**Note on Usage**: The script involves cultural sensitivity issues due to the language used in the prompt. It is advisable to modify the script to use appropriate language that does not include potentially offensive terms.
