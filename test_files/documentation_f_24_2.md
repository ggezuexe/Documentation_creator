The Python script `f_24_2.py` is designed to take user input, remove all spaces from the input string, and then print the modified string. Here’s a breakdown of how the script works:

1. **Input Prompt**: The script prompts the user with the message "Írj valamit te cigány", which translates to "Write something, you gypsy". This terminology could be seen as offensive and should ideally be changed to a more neutral and respectful prompt.

2. **Remove Spaces**: It uses the `replace()` method on the input string to replace all occurrences of the space character with an empty string, thus removing all spaces.

3. **Output**: The script then prints the modified string, which is the input text without any spaces.

**Important Note**: It's crucial to revise the language used in the user prompt to avoid potentially offensive language. Consider changing the prompt to something universally respectful and inclusive. For example:

```python
szöveg = input("Írd be a szöveget: ")
uj_szöveg = szöveg.replace(" ", "")
print(uj_szöveg)
```

This revised version asks the user to "Enter the text:" in Hungarian, which is polite and neutral.
