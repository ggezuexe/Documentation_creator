The Python file `f_18.py` contains a script that calculates and prints the sum of all integers between two numbers provided by the user. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the file's contents:

1. **Function Definition (`összeg`)**:
   - The function `összeg` is defined with two parameters, `szam1` and `szam2`.
   - It initializes a variable `szam_össz` to zero, which will store the sum of the numbers.
   - It checks if `szam1` is less than `szam2`. If true, it sums up all numbers between `szam1` and `szam2` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
   - If `szam1` is greater than `szam2`, it sums up all numbers between `szam2` and `szam1` (inclusive). **This specific part of the script contains an error:** it uses a variable `szam_2` which is not defined; it should be `szam2` instead.
   - The function returns the calculated sum.

2. **User Input Handling**:
   - The script prompts the user to enter two integers using the `input` function and converts them to integers.
   - These values are stored in `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

3. **Function Call and Output**:
   - The `összeg` function is called with `szam_1` and `szam_2` as arguments, and the result is stored in `szamok_összege`.
   - Finally, the sum is printed out with a message using the `print` function.

Overall, this script allows users to calculate and display the sum of numbers in a specified range, but it contains a minor bug which needs correction in the variable name used in one of the conditional blocks.
