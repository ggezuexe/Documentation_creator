### File Description for `f_18.py`

#### Purpose:
The script `f_18.py` calculates the sum of all integers between two numbers provided by the user, inclusive of the numbers themselves. The order of the numbers (i.e., whether the first is greater than or less than the second) does not affect the outcome.

#### Function Description:
- **Function Name:** `összeg`
- **Parameters:**
  - `szam1` (int): The first integer input by the user.
  - `szam2` (int): The second integer input by the user.
- **Returns:** 
  - `szam_össz` (int): The sum of all integers between `szam1` and `szam2`, inclusive.

#### Process:
1. The function first initializes a variable `szam_össz` to 0, which is used to store the cumulative sum.
2. It checks whether `szam1` is less than `szam2`. If this condition holds, the function sums up numbers from `szam1` to `szam2` using a `for` loop.
3. If `szam1` is greater than `szam2`, due to a typo, the loop attempts to iterate from `szam_2` to `szam_1`, which will cause a runtime error since `szam_2` is not defined in the scope of the function.
4. The function returns the total sum calculated.

#### User Interaction:
- The user is prompted to enter two integers, which are read and converted from strings to integers using the `int()` function.
- These integers serve as inputs to the `összeg` function.

#### Output:
- Outputs the sum of numbers between the two input integers, inclusive, unless an exception occurs due to the typo in variable naming (`szam_2` should be `szam2`).

#### Error Handling:
- Currently, the function does not handle non-integer inputs and will raise a ValueError if non-integer values are entered.
- Additionally, there is a variable name mismatch (`szam_2` should be `szam2`) which will lead to a NameError if the first integer is greater than the second.

#### Suggested Improvements:
- Correct the typo in the function from `szam_2` to `szam2` to ensure functionality no matter the order of input integers.
- Implement error handling to gracefully manage non-integer inputs or other exceptions during runtime.
