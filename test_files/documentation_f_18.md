The Python script `f_18.py` defines and utilizes a function to calculate the inclusive sum of all integers between two provided numbers. The functionality is encapsulated in the function named `összeg`, which takes two parameters, `szam1` and `szam2`. The function checks which number is smaller and iterates from the smaller to the larger number, summing up all integers in that range.

### Key Components of the Script:
1. **Function `összeg(szam1, szam2)`**:
   - **Parameters**: `szam1` and `szam2` (both are expected to be integers).
   - **Process**:
     - Initializes a variable `szam_össz` to zero to store the sum.
     - Uses an `if` condition to determine the order of `szam1` and `szam2`.
     - Includes two `for` loops, depending on whether `szam1` is less than or greater than `szam2`, to sum the numbers inclusively between `szam1` and `szam2`.
   - **Return Value**: Returns the calculated sum (`szam_össz`).

2. **User Input**:
   - The script takes two integer inputs from the user to serve as the arguments for the `összeg` function.

3. **Output**:
   - Computes the sum of numbers in the range defined by the input values.
   - Prints the result in a formatted string that indicates the cumulative sum of the numbers.
   
### Correctness and Error Handling:
- The current script has potential issues:
  - The variable `szam_2` in the second `for` loop is likely a typo. It should be `szam2`.
  - There is no explicit error handling for non-integer inputs which could lead to a `ValueError` if the input is not convertible to an integer.
  - It doesn't explicitly handle the case where `szam1` is equal to `szam2`, although the mathematical result will still be correct (it counts the number itself).

### Example Execution:
- If a user enters `3` and `5`, the function will compute 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
- If inputs are `5` and `3`, correcting the typo, it should compute the sum as 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

The script is intended for basic interactive summing tasks and demonstrates basic Python programming constructs like functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.
