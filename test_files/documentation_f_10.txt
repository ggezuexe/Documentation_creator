The Python script `f_10.py` is designed to calculate and print the sum of the first 'n' positive integers, where 'n' is a user input. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the script:

1. The script starts by requesting the user to input a positive integer. This value is stored in the variable `szam`.
2. It then checks if the entered value is greater than 0 to verify that it's positive.
3. If the value is positive, it initializes two variables: `x` (which is used to keep track of the current integer being added) and `összeg` (which maintains the running total of the sum).
4. A `for` loop runs from 0 to `szam - 1`. For each iteration:
    - It increments `x` by 1 (starting from 1, effectively counting from 1 to `szam`).
    - It adds the value of `x` to `összeg` in each iteration, thereby accumulating the sum of all integers from 1 to `szam`.
5. After the loop concludes, it prints the total sum calculated in the variable `összeg`.
6. If the initial value entered is not greater than 0 (i.e., it's either zero or negative), the script prints "Ez nem egy pozitív szám", indicating the input is not a positive number.

This script effectively demonstrates basic conditional checks, user input handling, and loop-based arithmetic operations in Python. Moreover, it uses both English and Hungarian in its implementation, particularly in variable names and output statements.
