The file `f_11.py` contains a Python script that prompts the user to input a positive integer. If the entered number is indeed positive, the script then outputs a sequence of 0's and 1's, alternating for as many times as the specified number. Specifically, for each index in the range from zero up to (but not including) the input number, if the index is even, it prints `0`; if the index is odd, it prints `1`. If the user enters a non-positive number (i.e., zero or a negative number), the script displays an error message stating "Ez nem egy pozitív szám", which translates to "This is not a positive number" in English.
