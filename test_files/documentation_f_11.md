The Python script `f_11.py` prompts the user to input a positive integer. It then checks if the entered number is greater than 0. If it is, the script proceeds to print a sequence, alternating between "0" and "1", for the number of times specified by the input integer. Specifically, it prints "0" for even indices and "1" for odd indices (starting the index from 0). If the entered value is not a positive integer, the script outputs the message "Ez nem egy pozitív szám," which translates from Hungarian to "This is not a positive number."
