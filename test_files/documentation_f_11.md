The Python script `f_11.py` prompts the user to input a positive integer and performs an action based on the provided input. If the input is a positive integer, the script prints a sequence of 0s and 1s up to the number just before the entered integer. Specifically, numbers at even indices in this sequence are represented by '0', and those at odd indices are represented by '1'. If the entered number is not positive, the script outputs a message indicating the input is not a positive number.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the script's functionality:

1. The script starts by asking the user to input a positive integer and stores it in the variable `szam`.
2. It checks if `szam` is greater than 0.
   - If true, it enters a `for` loop that iterates from 0 up to, but not including, the number stored in `szam`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - For indices that are even (e.g., 0, 2, 4), it prints '0'.
     - For indices that are odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5), it prints '1'.
3. If the input number is not greater than 0, it prints the message "Ez nem egy pozitív szám" to indicate that the entered number is not a positive integer.

This script is useful for generating a binary pattern based on the integer input and can serve as an educational tool for understanding basic Python control structures such as conditional statements and loops.
