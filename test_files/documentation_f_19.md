The Python script `f_19.py` performs a character comparison between two user-inputted strings to identify common characters present in both. Below is a detailed breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Input Collection:**
   - The script prompts the user twice to input text. The first input is stored in the variable `szó_1`, and the second in `szó_2`.

2. **Initialization of a List:**
   - An empty list named `azonosak` is created to store characters that are found in both strings.

3. **Nested Loop for Comparison:**
   - A nested loop structure is used where each character `i` from `szó_1` is compared with every character `x` from `szó_2`.
   - If a matching character is found (i.e., `i == x`), the script checks if this character is already in the list `azonosak` to avoid duplicates. If it is not in the list, it is added.

4. **Output Results:**
   - After comparing all characters, the script checks if the `azonosak` list is not empty.
   - If there are common characters, it prints "Megtalálható mindkát szóban:" followed by the list of these characters.
   - If no common characters are found, it prints "Nincsenek azonos betűk" (meaning "There are no common letters").

This script is useful for identifying overlapping characters between two sets of input strings, which can have applications in various text processing and analytical tasks.
