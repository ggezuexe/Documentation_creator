The Python script, `f_19.py`, performs character analysis based on user inputs. It requests the user to input two strings and then determines which characters are common between both inputs. The script uses two nested loops to compare every character in the first string against every character in the second string. If a common character is found and is not already noted in the list, it adds the character to a list (`azonosak`). After processing both strings, the script checks if the `azonosak` list is not empty. If it contains characters, it prints them as characters found in both strings. Otherwise, it notifies the user that there are no common characters between the two inputs.
