The Python script, `f_24.py`, reads a user input as a string, splits the string into a list of words based on spaces, and then concatenates these words into a new string without spaces between them. The resulting concatenated string is then printed to the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Request**: The script begins by prompting the user to enter some text. The prompt "Írj valamit te cigány" is displayed to the user.

2. **Split Input into List**: The entered string is then split by spaces, resulting in a list of words.

3. **Concatenate Words**: The script initializes an empty string `uj_szöveg` and iterates through the list of words, appending each word to `uj_szöveg` without adding any spaces between them.

4. **Output Result**: Finally, the concatenated string which consists of all the input words without spaces is printed.

Note: The input prompt contains a phrase that can be considered offensive in certain contexts. It's essential to ensure that prompts and messages within code are professional and respectful to all users.
