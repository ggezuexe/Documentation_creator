The Python script named `f_21.py` defines and uses a function `csillag()` to print a series of asterisks (`*`). The number of asterisks printed is determined by the length of a text input provided by the user.

### Function Description:
- **Name:** `csillag`
- **Parameter:** `szó_1` -> a string input, which is the text based on whose length the asterisks will be printed.
- **Behavior:** The function enters a for loop, iterating once for each character in the input string `szó_1`. In each iteration, it prints a single asterisk. After completing the loop for all characters in `szó_1`, the function returns `None`.

### User Interaction:
- The script prompts the user to input a text with the message "Adj meg egy szöveget" which translates to "Enter a text".
- It then calls the `csillag()` function using the user-provided text as an argument.

### Example Usage:
If the user enters "hello", the output will be:
```
*
*
*
*
*
```

There are five asterisks printed, one for each character in the word "hello". 

This script can be particularly useful for visual demonstrations or simple exercises involving string manipulation and loop functions in Python.
