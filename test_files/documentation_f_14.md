The file `f_14.py` contains a Python script that defines and utilizes a function to draw a rectangle using asterisks (*). The function named `teglalap` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `m`, which represent the dimensions (width and height, respectively) of the rectangle to be drawn. In the function, nested loops are used to print `n` asterisks on each line for a total of `m` lines, thereby constructing a rectangle shape on the console.

Below the function definition, the script prompts the user to input two integers. These integers are then passed to the `teglalap` function to draw a rectangle with the specified width (`n`) and height (`m`).

Here's a breakdown of the script activities:
1. Definition of `teglalap`, which prints a rectangle of asterisks based on the provided dimensions.
2. Script prompts the user for the width and height of the rectangle.
3. The rectangle is printed to the console using the user-provided dimensions.

The purpose of the script is straightforward: to allow a user to dynamically create rectangles of asterisks with dimensions specified through user input.
