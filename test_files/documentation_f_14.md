The file `f_14.py` contains a Python script that defines and utilizes a function named `teglalap` to print a rectangle made of asterisks (*) based on user-provided dimensions. Below is a breakdown of the functionality encapsulated within the file:

### Function Description:
- **Function Name:** `teglalap`
- **Parameters:**
  - `n`: An integer denoting the width of the rectangle (number of asterisks per line).
  - `m`: An integer denoting the height of the rectangle (number of lines).
- **Behavior:** The function iterates `m` times, each time printing a line of `n` asterisks, resulting in an `m`-high rectangle that is `n` asterisks wide.
- **Return Value:** None.

### Script Execution Flow:
1. **Input Reception:**
   - The script prompts the user twice to input integers. The first input is stored in variable `n` and represents the width of the rectangle. The second input is stored in variable `m` and represents the height of the rectangle.
  
2. **Function Call:**
   - The `teglalap` function is called with `n` and `m` as arguments.

### Use Case:
This script can typically be used in scenarios where a simple visual representation is needed, for instance in educational settings to demonstrate loops and function calls, or as a simple console-based visual output.

### Example:
If a user inputs 5 for `n` and 3 for `m`, the output will be:
```
*****
*****
*****
```

This script depends on standard input from the user, and might be extended or modified to handle different shapes, additional user interactions, or error handling to deal with non-integer inputs.
