The file `f_14.py` contains a Python script that defines a function `teglalap(n, m)` which prints a rectangle made of asterisk (`*`) characters. The dimensions of the rectangle are determined by the parameters `n` (width) and `m` (height) passed to the function. Following the function definition, the script prompts the user to input two integers, `n` and `m`, which represent the width and height of the rectangle, respectively. After receiving the inputs, the script then calls the `teglalap` function with the user-provided dimensions to print the rectangle on the screen.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the script's execution:

1. The function `teglalap(n, m)` is defined:
   - It takes two parameters, `n` (width) and `m` (height).
   - It uses two nested loops: the outer loop iterates `m` times (once for each row), and the inner loop iterates `n` times (once for each column in a row), printing an asterisk without moving to a new line (`end=""` keeps the cursor on the same line).
   - A call to `print("")` after the inner loop completes moves the cursor to the next line to start the next row of asterisks.
   - The function returns nothing (`return`).

2. The script gathers user input:
   - It prompts the user twice using `input()`, asking them to enter integer values for `n` and `m`.

3. With the values collected from the user (`n` and `m`), the `teglalap` function is called to print a rectangle based on the user's inputs.

This script is useful for visualizing rectangle dimensions dynamically, based on user input. It can be modified or expanded in various ways depending on the user's needs, such as changing the character used for drawing or adding boundary conditions for input values.
