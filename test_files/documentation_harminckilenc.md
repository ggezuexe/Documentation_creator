The Python file named `harminckilenc.py` uses the `turtle` graphics module to interactively draw regular polygons based on user input. Below is a detailed description of its functionality:

1. **Importing the Turtle Module**:
   The script begins by importing the `turtle` module, which provides graphical capabilities that allow for drawing shapes using a virtual turtle.

2. **Definition of the `paint` Function**:
   - The function `paint` takes a single parameter, `number`, which specifies the number of sides of the polygon to be drawn.
   - It starts by resetting the drawing screen using `turtle.resetscreen()`.
   - A new Turtle object `t` is initialized.
   - The variable `szog` (angle in Hungarian) is computed to determine the inner corner angle of the polygon using the formula `180 - (((number - 2) * 180) / number)`.
   - The function uses a loop to direct the turtle `t` to draw the polygon. In each iteration, the turtle turns left by the `szog` angle and moves forward by 100 units.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The script continuously prompts the user for input, asking for the number of sides (`n`) of the desired polygon.
   - The input is taken using `input()` and converted into an integer.
   - A conditional statement checks if `n` is within the range of 3 to 9 inclusive. If `n` is within this range, the `paint(n)` function is called to draw the polygon.
   - If the input is out of the specified range, a message "Ilyet nem tudok :c" ("I can't do that :c" in Hungarian) is printed, and the program exits the loop and ends.

This program allows the user to draw regular polygons with sides ranging from 3 to 9. It leverages the visual capabilities of the `turtle` module making it a straightforward and interactive way to understand geometry and the Python programming interface of the turtle graphics.
