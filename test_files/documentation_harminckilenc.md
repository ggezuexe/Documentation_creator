The `harminckilenc.py` file is a Python script that utilizes the `turtle` graphics module to draw regular polygons based on user input. Here's a breakdown of how the script operates:

1. **Imports Turtle Module**: The script begins by importing the `turtle` module. This module is used to create simple graphical drawings using a cursor (turtle) that moves around the screen.

2. **Function Definition - `paint(number)`**:
   - This function starts by resetting the turtle screen using `turtle.resetscreen()`.
   - It creates a screen `s` and a turtle `t` for drawing.
   - It calculates the internal angle `szog` (Hungarian for 'angle') needed to turn the turtle to form the edges of a polygon with a specified number of sides (`number`).
   - A loop runs to draw the polygon: the turtle turns by the computed angle and moves forward a fixed distance (100 units).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The script enters an infinite loop, continually asking the user to input the number of sides (`n`) of a regular polygon they wish to draw.
   - If the user inputs a number between 3 and 9 (inclusive), the `paint(n)` function is called to draw the polygon.
   - If the user inputs a number outside this range, the script prints an error message "Ilyet nem tudok :c" (translating to "I can't do that :c" in English) and breaks out of the loop, terminating the program.

This script is engaging as it interacts with the user to create different polygons, thus demonstrating the capabilities of Python's turtle graphics in a simple and educative manner.
