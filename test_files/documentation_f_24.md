The file `f_24.py` contains a Python script that performs the following operations:

1. **Input Collection**: The program prompts the user with the message "Írj valamit te cigány" and expects an input. The user types a string of text as a response.
   
2. **String Splitting**: The entered text is split into a list of words using the `split()` method. This function splits the string at spaces by default, which separates words and stores them as elements in a list named `szöveg_lista`.

3. **Concatenation Process**: An empty string `uj_szöveg` is initially declared. The script then iterates over each word in `szöveg_lista` and concatenates them back together without any spaces between the words, effectively removing the original spaces from the user's input.

4. **Output**: Finally, the concatenated string `uj_szöveg` is printed to the console.

**Note**: The input prompt phrase contains a term that might be considered offensive in certain contexts. It's advisable to use neutral and respectful language in user prompts to maintain the inclusiveness and professionalism of your code.
