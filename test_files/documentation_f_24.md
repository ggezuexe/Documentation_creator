The Python script `f_24.py` performs the following operations:

1. It prompts the user to input a string of text using the prompt "Írj valamit" which translates to "Write something" in English.
2. The input string is then split into a list of words using the `split()` method. This method by default splits the string at spaces, so each word becomes a separate element in the list `szöveg_lista`.
3. An empty string `uj_szöveg` is initialized to accumulate the words from the list.
4. The script iterates over the list of words (`szöveg_lista`) using a for loop. During each iteration, the current word is concatenated to `uj_szöveg` without any spaces, effectively removing the spaces from the original input.
5. Finally, the concatenated string (now devoid of spaces) is printed.

In essence, the script asks for a textual input, removes the spaces between the words, and outputs the result.
