The Python script defined in `f_18.py` includes a function and a script execution section designed to compute the summation of all integers between two given numbers inclusive.

### Description of the File Content:

**Function: `összeg`**
- **Parameters**: `szam1`, `szam2` (both are expected to be integers)
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the summation of all integers from `szam1` to `szam2`, inclusive. The order of `szam1` and `szam2` does not matter; it calculates the sum regardless of which is larger.
- **Logic**: 
  - If `szam1` is less than `szam2`, it iterates from `szam1` to `szam2` and sums the values.
  - If `szam1` is greater than `szam2`, there appears to be a typographic error in the variable name (`szam_2` should be `szam2`); however, the intention seems to be to iterate from `szam2` to `szam1` and sum the values.

**Execution Section**:
- The script prompts the user to input two integers.
- It then calls the `összeg` function with the input integers and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the calculated sum of the numbers in a formatted string.

### Correction Note:
There's a typo in the logic part; the variable `szam_2` (in the `elif` block) should be corrected to `szam2` for the function to work correctly.

### Usage:
Run the script, provide two integers when prompted, and it outputs their inclusive sum. This can be particularly useful for simple educational purposes or quick calculations that involve sequential numerical summation.
