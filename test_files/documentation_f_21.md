The Python script `f_21.py` defines a function named `csillag` that takes one argument, `szó_1`. The purpose of this function is to print an asterisk (`*`) on the screen for each character present in the argument `szó_1`. It does this by running a loop that iterates as many times as there are characters in `szó_1`, printing an asterisk during each iteration.

After defining the function, the script prompts the user to input a text string by displaying the message "Adj meg egy szöveget" (Hungarian for "Enter a text"). This input is then stored in the variable `szó`. The `szó` variable is subsequently passed as an argument to the `csillag` function, triggering the printing of asterisks corresponding to the length of the input text.

Overall, the function does not return any value; its primary side effect is to produce a visual output to the screen.
