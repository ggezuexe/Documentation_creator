The file named `f_21.py` contains a Python script that defines a function named `csillag` which takes a single input argument called `szó_1`. This function, when called, prints an asterisk (`*`) for each character in the input string `szó_1`. It does not return any value.

Below the function definition, the script prompts the user to enter a text (szöveg) which is stored in the variable `szó`. The `csillag` function is then called with the user-provided input as an argument. The result of this operation is that for each character in the entered text, an asterisk is printed on a new line. For example, if the input text is "hello", the output would look like:

```
*
*
*
*
*
```

This script demonstrates basic usage of functions, for-loops, and user input manipulation in Python.
