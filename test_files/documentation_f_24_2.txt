The file `f_24_2.py` is a Python script that contains a small program to process user input. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Input Prompt**: The program prompts the user to enter some text with the message "Írj valamit te cigány". Please note, the phrase used in the input prompt contains a term that can be considered offensive and inappropriate. It's recommended to use respectful and neutral language in user interfaces to ensure inclusivity and avoid promoting negative sentiments.

2. **Text Manipulation**: After receiving the input, the script removes all spaces from the entered text using the `replace` method. The original text is modified by replacing all spaces (" ") with no space (""), effectively concatenating all words into a single string.

3. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the newly modified text without spaces to the console.

### Example Usage
If a user inputs "hello world", the script will output "helloworld".

### Recommendations
1. **Change the Input Prompt**: Consider altering the input text to something neutral, e.g., "Please enter some text:".
2. **Extending Functionality**: You might want to add functionality such as handling or removing other types of whitespace or allowing the user to choose which characters to remove.

This script is useful for textual data preprocessing where removing spaces or formatting text is needed.
