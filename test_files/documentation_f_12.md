The Python script defined in the file `f_12.py` is designed to take two positive integer inputs from the user and perform the following actions based on the input values:

1. **Input Collection:** The script prompts the user twice to input positive integers. These inputs are stored in variables `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

2. **Conditional Check and Loop Execution:**
   - If the first input (`szam_1`) is less than the second input (`szam_2`), the script enters a for loop.
   - Inside the for loop, it prints each integer starting from one more than `szam_1` up to one less than `szam_2`. This effectively lists all the integers between `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

3. **Error Handling:** If `szam_1` is not smaller than `szam_2`, the script prints the message "Rosszul adtad meg," which translates to "You entered it incorrectly" in English, indicating that the input did not meet the expected condition (i.e., `szam_1` being less than `szam_2`).

This script is useful for situations where a user needs to view a range of numbers between two specific points, provided the starting number is less than the ending number. It emphasizes basic input handling, condition checking, and loop operations in Python.
