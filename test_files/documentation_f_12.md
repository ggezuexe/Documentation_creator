The Python script in `f_12.py` prompts the user to input two positive integers and then checks which number is smaller. If the first number (`szam_1`) is smaller than the second number (`szam_2`), it prints all the integers that lie between these two numbers. If the first number is not smaller than the second, it prints an error message indicating incorrect input.
