The Python script `f_12.py` requests the user to input two positive integers, `szam_1` and `szam_2`. It then checks if the first number (`szam_1`) is lesser than the second number (`szam_2`). If this condition is true, the script prints all the integers that fall between the two numbers. If the condition is false (i.e., `szam_1` is greater than or equal to `szam_2`), the script outputs a message indicating an error in input: "Rosszul adtad meg" which translates from Hungarian as "You entered it incorrectly".
