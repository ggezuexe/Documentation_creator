The file `f_12.py` contains a Python script designed to solicit two positive integers from the user and then perform a simple comparison and action based on the input values. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. **Input Collection:**
   - The script prompts the user twice, each time asking for a positive integer. These inputs are stored in `szam_1` and `szam_2` respectively.

2. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The script checks if `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`. If this condition is true, it enters a loop that starts at one number above `szam_1` and ends just before `szam_2`, printing each number in this range.
   - If `szam_1` is not less than `szam_2`, the script prints a message indicating an incorrect input ("Rosszul adtad meg"), suggesting that the expected order of input was not followed.

The script assumes user compliance with the request for positive integers and does not include error handling for non-integer inputs or negative numbers. It focuses on demonstrating basic input handling, conditional logic, and loop iteration in Python.
