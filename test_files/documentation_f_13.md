The Python script `f_13.py` prompts the user to input two positive integers and then performs the following operations based on the comparison of these numbers:

1. **User Input**: The script begins by requesting the user to enter two positive integers, referred to as `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

2. **Comparison and Loop Execution**:
   - If `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`, the script iterates through the range of numbers between `szam_1` and `szam_2` (exclusive of `szam_2` and inclusive of one more than `szam_1`). During the iteration, it checks each number to determine if it is even. If a number is even, it is printed to the output.
   - Conversely, if `szam_1` is greater than `szam_2`, the script iterates through the range between `szam_2` and `szam_1` (exclusive of `szam_1` and inclusive of one more than `szam_2`). It checks each number in this range in the same manner, printing out the even numbers.

3. **Equal Inputs**:
   - If `szam_1` equals `szam_2`, the script simply prints out the message "A két szám egyenlő," which means "The two numbers are equal" in Hungarian.

The script provides a simple way to display all even numbers between two entered values, facilitating the understanding of loops, conditions, and basic user input handling in Python.
