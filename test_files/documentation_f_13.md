The Python script `f_13.py` is designed to accept two positive integers from the user and then perform actions based on their comparative values. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

1. **User Input:** The script prompts the user to input two positive integers, referred to as `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

2. **Comparison and Execution:**
    - If `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`, the script will iterate through all integers between `szam_1` and `szam_2` (exclusive of both).
    - For each integer in this range, it checks if the integer is even. If it is, the integer is printed.
    - Conversely, if `szam_1` is greater than `szam_2`, it performs a similar iteration and check, but between the values of `szam_2` and `szam_1`.
    - If the two numbers are equal, the script prints "A két szám egyenlő" which translates to "The two numbers are equal" in English.

3. **Purpose:** This script can be used for finding and outputting all the even numbers situated between two given integers input by the user. It helps understand basic loop functionalities, conditional statements, and user interactions in Python.

Overall, this script is particularly useful for educational purposes to illustrate control flow, use of loops, and conditional branching based on user input.
