The Python file `f_13.py` is a script that prompts the user to enter two positive integers. After inputting these numbers, the script will perform the following actions based on the relationship between the two integers:

1. **If the first number is less than the second**: The script prints all even numbers that exist between the first and second number (exclusive of both).
2. **If the first number is greater than the second**: The script similarly prints all even numbers that exist between the second and the first number (exclusive of both).
3. **If both numbers are equal**: The script prints a message stating that the two numbers are equal.

Key behaviors of the script:
- It ensures that the numbers for comparison and the printing of even numbers are always non-inclusive, meaning it starts checking from the number just greater than the smaller number and stops before the larger number.
- The script checks for even numbers using the modulus operator (`%`), which determines whether the remainder is zero when a number is divided by 2, defining it as even.
- Exception handling for non-integer inputs isn't explicitly stated, so the script expects users to input valid integers to work correctly.

This script can be useful for basic numeric comparisons and understanding the use of conditionals and loops in Python.
