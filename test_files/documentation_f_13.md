The Python script `f_13.py` is designed to prompt the user for two positive integer inputs and then perform actions based on the comparison of these two numbers. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Input Collection**: The script asks the user to input two positive integers, referred to as `szam_1` and `szam_2`.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
    - If `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`, the script enters a loop that iterates through the numbers between `szam_1` and `szam_2`.
    - For each number in this range, the script checks if the number is even. If it is, the number is printed to the console.
    - This process is repeated with the roles of `szam_1` and `szam_2` reversed if `szam_1` is greater than `szam_2`.
  
3. **Equality Check**: If `szam_1` and `szam_2` are found to be equal, the script prints the message "A két szám egyenlő" which translates to "The two numbers are equal."

This script is useful for finding and displaying all even numbers between two given values, adjusting the range order based on the relative magnitude of the inputs.
