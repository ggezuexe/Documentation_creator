The Python script `f_10.py` prompts the user to input a positive integer. Upon receiving the input, the script checks whether the number is positive. If the number is indeed positive, it calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to the entered number minus one. This total sum is then printed. If the input is not a positive number, the script outputs a message indicating that the entered value is not a positive integer. The purpose of the script is to demonstrate simple input handling, conditional checking, and loop processing in Python.
