The file `f_10.py` contains a Python script that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It then calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to the entered number minus one, and prints the sum. If the entered number is not positive, it outputs an error message indicating that the input is not a positive number.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Input Request**: The code begins by asking the user to input a positive integer. This input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable `szam`.

2. **Condition Check**: An `if` statement checks if the entered integer (`szam`) is greater than 0.

3. **Sum Calculation**: If the condition is true:
   - `x` and `összeg` are initialized to 0. Here, `összeg` will be used to keep the running total of the sum.
   - A `for` loop runs from 0 to `szam - 1`. In each iteration, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1, and this value is added to `összeg`.
   - After exiting the loop, the total sum (`összeg`) is printed.

4. **Error Handling**: If the initial condition (`szam > 0`) is false, the script will print a message indicating that the entered number is not positive.

This script is useful for simple arithmetic operations and input validation, providing a direct demonstration of basic loop and condition handling in Python.
