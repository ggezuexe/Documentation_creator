The Python script `f_10.py` is designed to compute and display the sum of all positive integers up to a user-specified number. Here’s a breakdown of the operations performed in the script:

1. The script prompts the user to enter a positive integer with the message "Adj meg egy pozitív egész számot". The input from the user is then converted to an integer and stored in the variable `szam`.

2. It checks whether the entered number (`szam`) is greater than 0. If it is not, the script prints "Ez nem egy pozitív szám", indicating that the entered number is not a positive number.

3. If the number is positive, the script proceeds with the following operations:
   - Initializes two variables, `x` to 0 and `összeg` (sum) to 0.
   - Uses a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `szam - 1`. In each iteration:
     - The loop index `i` is incremented by 1 and assigned to `x`.
     - The value of `x` is then added to `összeg`.
   - After completing the loop, it prints the cumulative sum of numbers from 1 to `szam - 1` in the format "A számok összeg: X", where X is the calculated sum.

This script is a simple computational tool tailored to work with positive integers and efficiently calculates the sum of all integers leading up to a chosen number in a user-friendly manner.
