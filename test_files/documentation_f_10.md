The Python script `f_10.py` is designed to calculate the sum of natural numbers up to a user-inputted positive integer. Here’s a breakdown of how the script operates:

1. **Input Request**: The program prompts the user to input a positive integer. This value is stored in the variable `szam`.

2. **Input Validation**: The script checks if the entered integer is greater than 0. If it's not, the script outputs "Ez nem egy pozitív szám" (which translates to "This is not a positive number") and terminates the execution.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - If the entered integer is positive, the program initializes two variables, `x` and `összeg` (which means "sum"), to manage the iteration and accumulation of the sum respectively.
   - A `for` loop iterates from 0 to one less than the entered number (`szam - 1`). In each iteration, it updates the value of `x` to the current loop index plus one, and accumulates the sum of these values in `összeg`.

4. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints "A számok összeg:" followed by the calculated sum, providing the summed total of all integers from 1 up to and including the number just below the user's input.

This script effectively provides a simple demonstration of user input handling, condition checking, and loop-based arithmetic operations in Python.
