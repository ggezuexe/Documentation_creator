### Summary of Python Files

**1. f_10.py**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to a user-provided number minus one, if the number is positive.
   - **User Input**: A positive integer (`szam`).
   - **Main Logic**: Uses a loop to add each integer to a cumulative sum (`összeg`) and prints the result.
   - **Output**: Displays the sum of integers from 1 to `szam-1`.

**2. f_11.py**
   - **Purpose**: Print a sequence of 0 and 1 for a user-input number of terms where even indices have 0 and odd indices have 1.
   - **User Input**: A positive integer (`szam`).
   - **Behavior**: Based on the input value, prints 0 or 1 for each index from 0 to `szam-1`.
   - **Output**: A sequence of alternating 0s and 1s.

**3. f_12.py**
   - **Purpose**: Print all integers between two user-input numbers (`szam_1` and `szam_2`) when `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`.
   - **User Input**: Two integers (`szam_1`, `szam_2`).
   - **Behavior**: If the first number is less than the second, prints all numbers between them.
   - **Output**: Sequential integers between `szam_1 + 1` and `szam_2 - 1`.

**4. f_13.py**
   - **Purpose**: Prints even numbers between two given numbers in ascending or descending order depending on their inputs.
   - **User Input**: Two integers (`szam_1`, `szam_2`).
   - **Behavior**: Prints even numbers between the two inputs, handling both possible orderings.
   - **Output**: Even numbers between `szam_1` and `szam_2` or the reverse.

**5. f_14.py**
   - **Purpose**: Draws a rectangle of asterisks with dimensions given by the user.
   - **User Input**: Two integers (`n`, `m`), representing width and height.
   - **Behavior**: Uses nested loops to print a rectangle made of asterisks.
   - **Output**: A rectangle of asterisks in the console.

**6. f_18.py**
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the sum of all integers between two inputs, inclusive and handles both orderings.
   - **User Input**: Two integers (`szam_1`, `szam_2`).
   - **Main Logic**: Based on the order of input, calculates the sum of all integers between the two numbers.
   - **Output**: Displays the sum of the numbers.

**7. f_19.py**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies and prints the common characters between two user-input strings.
   - **User Input**: Two strings (`szó_1`, `szó_2`).
   - **Behavior**: Finds and lists common characters without repetition.
   - **Output**: A list of common characters or a message indicating no commonalities.

**8. f_21.py**
   - **Purpose**: Print a vertical line of asterisks as long as the input string.
   - **User Input**: A string (`szó`).
   - **Behavior**: Prints one asterisk per character in the input string.
   - **Output**: Vertical line of asterisks.

**9. f_24.py**
   - **Purpose**: Removes spaces from a user-entered string and concatenates the words.
   - **User Input**: A string (`szöveg`).
   - **Behavior**: Splits the string into words and joins them together without spaces.
   - **Output**: The concatenated string.

**10. f_24_2.py**
    - **Purpose**: Another approach to remove spaces from a user-entered string.
    - **User Input**: A string (`szöveg`).
    - **Behavior**: Uses the replace method to eliminate spaces.
    - **Output**: The concatenated string.

**11. harminckilenc.py**
    - **Purpose**: Draws a regular polygon with the number of sides specified by the user using the `turtle` graphical library.
    - **User Input**: An integer for the number of sides (`n`).
    - **Behavior**: Draws polygons, handling input validation for the number of sides (must be between 3 and 9).
    - **Output**: Graphical representation of the specified polygon or a termination message if the input is invalid.
