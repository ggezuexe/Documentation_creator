The Python script `f_10.py` implements a simple program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. If the input is a positive integer, it calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to the entered number minus one. After calculating the sum, it outputs the result. If the input is not a positive integer, it displays a message indicating that the input is not a positive number.

#### Detailed Breakdown of the Code:
1. The program starts by requesting an integer input from the user with a message prompt: "Adj meg egy pozitív egész számot" which translates to "Enter a positive integer".
2. It then checks if the entered number (`szam`) is greater than 0. If it is:
   - Initializes `x` to 0, used as a counter in the loop.
   - Initializes `összeg` (which means 'sum' in English) to 0, used to store the cumulative sum of integers.
   - Uses a `for loop` to iterate from 0 up to one less than the entered number (`szam - 1`).
   - Within the loop, it updates `x` to the current loop index plus 1 and increments `összeg` by the value of `x`.
   - Once the loop completes, it prints the sum using "A számok összeg:", followed by the calculated sum (`összeg`).
3. If the number is not greater than 0, it outputs: "Ez nem egy pozitív szám" which means "This is not a positive number".

This program could be used as an educational tool to demonstrate basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python. It also subtly introduces internationalization by using Hungarian in user interactions.
