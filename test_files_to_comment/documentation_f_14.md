The Python script `f_14.py` contains a function named `teglalap` and a section of code outside the function that handles user input and function invocation. Below is a detailed breakdown of each part:

### Function: `teglalap(n, m)`
- **Purpose**: This function prints a rectangle of asterisks (`*`).
- **Parameters**:
  - `n` (int): The width of the rectangle (number of asterisks in each row).
  - `m` (int): The height of the rectangle (number of rows).
- **Behavior**: The function employs two nested loops:
  - The outer loop iterates `m` times, corresponding to the height of the rectangle.
  - The inner loop iterates `n` times, printing an asterisk (`*`) each time, to form a row. After all asterisks in a row are printed, `print("")` is called to move to the next line.
- **Return Value**: The function returns `None`.

### Script Execution Flow
- After defining the function, the script prompts the user to input two integers:
  - The first input is stored in variable `n` and represents the width of the rectangle.
  - The second input is stored in variable `m` and represents the height of the rectangle.
- With the values of `n` and `m` provided by the user, the function `teglalap(n, m)` is called to print the rectangle on the screen.

### Usage
The script is interactive and expects user interaction through the console. Users provide the dimensions of the rectangle, which then gets printed immediately after entering the dimensions.

This script is straightforward and serves as a basic example of user interaction and loop control structures in Python. It can be used for educational purposes to demonstrate how functions, loops, and user inputs work in Python.
