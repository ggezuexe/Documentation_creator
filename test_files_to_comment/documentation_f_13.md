**File Name:** f_13.py

**Description:**

This Python script prompts the user to input two positive integers, `szam_1` and `szam_2`. The program then checks the relationship between these two integers and performs different actions based on their comparison:

1. **If `szam_1` is less than `szam_2`:** The script executes a loop from the number immediately greater than `szam_1` to one less than `szam_2`. Within this loop, it checks for even numbers and prints them.

2. **If `szam_1` is greater than `szam_2`:** The script similarly executes a loop from the number immediately greater than `szam_2` to one less than `szam_1`. It again checks for even numbers within this range and prints them.

3. **If `szam_1` and `szam_2` are equal:** The script simply outputs a message stating that the two numbers are equal.

**Usage:**
The script is straightforward and is executed from the command line. It waits for the user to enter the two integers after which it computes and displays the results based on the conditions mentioned. This can be used for educational purposes to understand loops, conditionals, and basic input/output operations in Python.
