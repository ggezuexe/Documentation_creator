The Python script named **f_21.py** contains a function called `csillag` designed to take a single string argument (`szó_1`). The primary function of `csillag` is to print an asterisk (`*`) the same number of times as the length of the input string.

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:
1. **Input Collection**: The script prompts the user to enter a text through the console input with the message "Adj meg egy szöveget" which translates to "Enter a text".
2. **Function Definition (`csillag`)**: This function is defined to accept one parameter, `szó_1`.
   - It includes a for loop that iterates as many times as the number of characters in `szó_1`.
   - In each iteration of the loop, it prints an asterisk (`*`).
3. **Execution of Function**: Finally, the script invokes the `csillag` function by passing the user's input (`szó`) as a parameter.

The script effectively visualizes the length of the input string in the form of asterisks on the console, with each asterisk representing one character of the input string. This can be used for simple demonstrations or educational purposes to show string length representation.
