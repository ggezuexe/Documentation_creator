The Python script `f_18.py` defines a function `összeg` which calculates the sum of all integers between two numbers provided by the user, inclusive. It handles both ascending and descending orders for the range of numbers based on the input values.

1. **Function Definition**:
   - **összeg(szam1, szam2):** This function accepts two parameters, `szam1` and `szam2`. It calculates the sum of integers between these two numbers. If `szam1` is less than `szam2`, it sums up all the integers from `szam1` to `szam2` (inclusive). Conversely, if `szam1` is greater than `szam2`, it sums all integers from `szam2` to `szam1` (inclusive).

2. **Main Execution Flow**:
   - The script prompts the user to input two integers.
   - These integers are passed as arguments to the `összeg` function.
   - The result, which is the sum of the integers between the two input numbers, is then printed to the console.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The script contains a bug in the branch where `szam1` > `szam2` due to a reference to an undefined variable `szam_2`. This should be corrected to `szam2`.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - The script uses `input()` function to interact with the user, requesting two integers which it then processes using the `összeg` function.

This script is simple and directly interacts with users, making it suitable for educational purposes or beginner programming tasks. It also showcases basic use of conditionals, loops, and user input handling in Python.
