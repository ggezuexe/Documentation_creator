The Python file `f_24.py` contains a script that performs text manipulation based on user input. Below is a detailed explanation of the operations performed by the script:

1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter some text. This is captured via the `input()` function and stored in the variable `szöveg`.

2. **Splitting Text**: The entered text (`szöveg`) is then split into individual words. This is done using the `split()` method, which by default splits the string at spaces. The resulting list of words is stored in `szöveg_lista`.

3. **Concatenation of Words**: The script initializes an empty string `uj_szöveg`. It then iterates over each word in `szöveg_lista`. For each iteration, the word is concatenated to `uj_szöveg` without adding any spaces between them.

4. **Output the Result**: Finally, the concatenated result, which is a string of all input words merged without spaces, is printed to the console.

Here's a simple scenario to understand its functionality:
- If a user inputs: `Hello World`
- The output would be: `HelloWorld`

This script effectively removes all spaces from the user's input and outputs the result as a single continuous string.
