The Python script named `harminckilenc.py` utilizes the `turtle` graphics module to draw regular polygons based on user input. Here's a breakdown of the functionality within this script:

1. **Importing the Turtle Module**: The script begins by importing the turtle module, which provides drawing capabilities.

2. **Defining the Paint Function**:
    - `paint(number)`: This function takes an integer `number` as an argument representing the number of sides of a regular polygon.
    - Inside the function:
        - `turtle.resetscreen()`: Clears any existing drawings and resets the turtle's state.
        - `s = turtle.getscreen()`: Retrieves the Turtle screen and stores it in variable `s`, although `s` is not explicitly used later.
        - `t = turtle.Turtle()`: Creates a new turtle object for drawing.
        - `szog = 180 - (((number - 2) * 180)/number)`: Calculates the internal angle for the polygon.
        - A loop runs `number` of times, where in each iteration:
            - The turtle turns left by `szog` degrees and moves forward by 100 units, drawing the sides of the polygon.

3. **Infinite Loop for User Input**:
    - The script continuously prompts the user to provide an integer input via:
      `"Milyen szab√°lyos poligont szeretne? "`, which translates to "What kind of regular polygon would you like?"
    - The script processes the input:
        - If the input integer `n` is between 3 and 9 (inclusive), the `paint` function is called with `n`, and the corresponding polygon is drawn.
        - If `n` is outside this range, the script prints `"Ilyet nem tudok :c"` meaning "I can't do that :c," and then the loop is terminated by `break`.

This script primarily serves as an interactive tool for users to visualize various regular polygons between triangles and nonagons (3 to 9 sides) using simple graphical representations. The user can repeatedly input values and directly see the corresponding polygon until they provide an input outside the specified range, at which point the program exits.
