The Python script `f_12.py` is designed to take two positive integer inputs from a user and print all the integers between these two numbers. Here's how it functions:

1. The script prompts the user twice to input a positive integer. These inputs are stored in the variables `szam_1` and `szam_2`.
2. The script then checks if the first number (`szam_1`) is lesser than the second number (`szam_2`).
3. If `szam_1` is indeed less than `szam_2`, the script uses a for-loop to iterate from the number immediately greater than `szam_1` to one less than `szam_2`, printing each of these numbers consecutively.
4. If the condition is not met (i.e., if `szam_1` is not less than `szam_2`), the script prints a message "Rosszul adtad meg", which in Hungarian means "You entered it incorrectly."

This script is useful for examining a sequence of integers between two specific points and can be used in basic numerical analyses or for educational purposes to demonstrate conditional statements and loops.
