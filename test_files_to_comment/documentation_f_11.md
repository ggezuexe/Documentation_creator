The Python script `f_11.py` is designed to prompt the user to input a positive integer. Once the user enters a number, the script checks if the number is indeed positive. If it is, the script proceeds to print a sequence of 0s and 1s based on whether the index `i` (starting from 0 up to the entered number minus one) is even or odd. Specifically, it prints '0' for even indices and '1' for odd indices. However, if the entered number is not positive, the script outputs the message "Ez nem egy pozitív szám", which translates to "This is not a positive number" in English.
